% ============= Abstract =============
\abstract{
    Advances in hand-tracking for VR applications allow users to experience virtual environments without controllers. There are already successful implementations of this however many are still stationary experiences. Using hand-tracking requires new locomotion techniques since there are no joysticks or buttons to press to move the users' avatar and there are no established solutions for this problem yet. This report describes the implementation of a flexible teleportation system using hand-tracking. The gesture detection is based on recorded gesture states that can be compared to the current joint positions.
    The project was conducted with the goal of preparing a study environment to compare different gesture-based teleportation systems that were found during a literature review as well as in commercial VR games. To check that the chosen gestures are intuitive, a small gesture elicitation study was performed. 
    The main part of this project is a VR environment, build with Unity and a server connected to the headset for various logging, visualization and debugging tasks.
