\chapter{Implementation}
The implementation had four major requirements. First, the different gestures selected should be combined into one immersive environment. They originate from different sources and have not been directly comparable before. The level of detail should be fairly high. Second, a task for the user should be implemented that is similar to what a teleportation task in a game is like. A fun task in an immersive world will keep study participants engaged. Third it should be possible to collect statistics about what the user does. This is important for the user study that will be performed later. The last requirement is to keep the system flexible so it could be adapted to different gesture recognition tasks or to other teleport systems in the future.

To solve the requirements, the following solution was implemented. It is build using a Unity client and a backend server.
