\chapter{Results from the Literature Research}

There is not much research focused on alternative locomotion techniques in VR that do not require controllers. It is a new and experimental field of study.

\section{Tracking Technology}
Locomotion systems using hand-tracking traditionally required external tracking devices like a leap motion sensor mounted to the VR headset. %TODO: cite
This works for a prototype but can not be expected to be something an end-user is able to set up. The studies conducted using the leap motion sensor also reported users complaining about the sensors field of view. %TODO: cite
The sensor has a 140° field of view and therefore can see the environment in front of the headset well, however it is not able to track hands if they are held below the headset or next to the users' body, where it would be more natural and ergonomic. A much more usable implementation of hand-tracking is implemented by the Oculus Quest headsets. %TODO: cite
The headset is using internal tracking using up to 4 cameras that are able to detect the users' hands using a trained neural network. %TODO: cite
Even though the cameras only produce black and white images and sometimes only one camera is able to see the hand, the tracking works remarkably well. There are however major limitations since the detection network is not trained to detect hand-to-hand interactions and therefore cuts out entirely until the user separates their hands again. The tracking is also sometimes inaccurate if some fingers are obstructed by others. In most cases this is not very visible to the user since the fingers are also obstructed from their perspective, it is however visible in the tracking information recorded by the headset and has to be taken into account. 

\section{Requirements for Teleportation Systems}

\section{Gestures}
The literature has come up with a handful of gestures and ways to study them in a laboratory environment. The games industry however has implemented some fully usable systems for actual users. Both types of sources were taken into account to produce this list of comparable gestures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One-Handed Palm Gesture: %TODO: cite
    Researchers propose a teleportation gesture that is using a single, wide-open hand. The target location is selected using a ray starting as the normal vector of the palm of the hand. The teleportation is then executed after 1.5 seconds.

    \item One-Handed Index Gesture: %TODO: cite
    Researchers propose a teleportation gesture that is using one hand with the index finger extended to use as a pointing device. To select a point, a user can just point at it. The teleportation is then executed after 1.5 seconds.
    
    \item Two-Handed Palm Gesture: %TODO: cite
    Same targeting gesture as the One-Handed Index Gesture. The second hand is used to confirm the teleport by opening the hand.

    \item One-Handed Index Gesture: %TODO: cite
    Same targeting gesture as the One-Handed Index Gesture. The second hand is used to confirm the teleport by extending the index finger.

    \item Triangle Gesture: %TODO: cite
    A game called Elixir which is a short hand-tracking demo for the Oculus Quest uses a bimanual gesture. Both hands form a triangle connecting both thumbs and index fingers. This can be used to target a point on the floor. To confirm the target location, the user pinches thumbs and index fingers together.
    
    \item Pull Gesture: %TODO: cite
    A game called Vacation Simulator has one of the best implementations of hand-tracking found in games so far. The locomotion is using a one-handed pulling gesture. In the game, this is only used for low-resolution target selection.
\end{itemize}

After my own subjective testing using a prototype of the final application, the systems using a time delay were found to be disorienting. Because the teleportation can not be confirmed explicitly it is not transparent to the user when it is going to be executed. The locomotion systems of the first four gestures are also very similar and lead to very similar results in the previous testing. Because of this, I decided to combine the one- and two-handed systems. The result is two one-handed systems that have a confirmation step to execute the teleportation. To get feedback on how intuitive this change was, a gesture elicitation study was performed. 

\section{Testing Methodology}
The internal test game studios are using are not known, so the sources for the testing methodology are limited. In the literature, many studies rely on completion time and the number of errors during a task as a measure of a good locomotion system. %TOOO: cite
This might cause some problems however since theoretically a system that can teleport right to the end of the environment would have a much better completion time than a system with a shorter teleport range even though this would not be a good system for the user. To combat this, it is necessary to have the same maximum teleport distance to compare systems. However, it would be better to not rely on the completion time as a measure and rather look for actual signs of user satisfaction. The number of errors seems like a good measure though since it can be very frustrating and disorienting to be teleported to the wrong location. 

The testing environments used for the studies are very diverse. Sometimes the prototype implementations are using a detailed environment so that it is very immersive for the test participant and other times it is created so that it is not distracting the player and therefore very clean and simple. %TODO: cite long path paper and 
Since there is no one-to-one comparison between results of the same locomotion system in a different environment, there is not an established, way to approach this.

The task the user is supposed to execute in the testing environment differs also depending on the study, however, mostly it is about teleporting to checkpoints along a corridor or in an open space. %cite corridor study
This way the user is forced to hit points in the world accurately. This mechanic is easy to test however it is also not that similar to a game or a productivity application that an actual user would use. The need to hit an exact point and teleporting around just to get from one point to another without an objective is rarely found. Therefore adding an objective like avoiding an enemy or searching for something in the environment while teleporting would create a more realistic testing environment. This puts the teleportation itself in the background as it would be in an actual implementation of a teleportation system. However, if the system is not satisfying to use, the user will be able to notice the deficiencies since it is impeding the objective. An objective like this would make the task completion measure even more of a problem since it would not be the fault of the teleportation system if the user can not complete the objective on the first try and then takes longer.
