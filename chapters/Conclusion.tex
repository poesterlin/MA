\chapter{Conclusion}

New technological leaps can be very exiting. The ability to capture the exact positions of every joint of a users hand opens up lots of possibilities as well as challenges. The goal of this evaluation was to be able to give a recommendation how the ideal gesture would look like that allows for comfortable, intuitive and accurate gesture based teleportation. However, it seems to be the case that there is more work to be done. The triangular gesture that uses both thumbs and index fingers to construct a triangle produces the best result in comparison
