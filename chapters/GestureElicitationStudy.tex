\chapter{Gesture Elicitation Study}
In order to get an overview over what kind of gesture systems can be considered intuitive a small Gesture Elicitation Study based on the research of Villarreal-Narvaez et al. \cite{elicitation} was performed. This was an important first step in the selection of the gesture systems to conduct further research on. Especially since none of the related work that focused on gesture based locomotion documented a user driven design approach.

\section{Study Setup}
The participants were instructed to come up with teleportation techniques and to explain them in detail. One and two-handed gesture systems are allowed. To understand the limitations of hand-tracking the subjects were wearing the Oculus Quest device with hand-tracking enabled. This way it is easy to tell which gesture is tracking well and what is not detected by the tracking cameras. A simple environment with only a plain on the bottom, the skybox and the users tracked virtual hands was used. The environment was created so that the focus lies on the hands and the gestures. During the study, the headset was connected to a simple web interface over which the study operator could record the current gesture. The recorded position data was stored for detailed analysis after the study. This was done because it would not have been realistic to record everything the participant does with their hands. The conversation between the operator and the participants was also recorded on video for analysis. The sessions lasted on average about six minutes.


\section{Results}
$33$ different gesture systems were collected from the video and gesture snapshot information, with five systems appearing twice. Nine gesture systems are not usable for the comparison since they are either not strictly teleportation systems or because they can not be compared to other teleportation methods like a system using a minimap or a type of proxy system. Out of the usable $24$ systems, seven use a bimanual approach while $17$ use one hand. This trend to one-handed gesture systems was also explicitly called for by two participants that expressed some possible downsides of bimanual systems. The participants reported more physical effort and not being able to carry something in one hand while teleporting as a disadvantage.

The usable gestures can be categorized into three large groups of similar gesture systems. 

The largest group of systems are all using at least one hand with the index finger extended to use as a pointing device. In total this method was proposed eight times. One gesture is also using an extended middle finger to make the gesture more distinct (\ref{fig:index2}) but the targeting system otherwise works the same. Six times the system was proposed to have a confirmation step before the teleport is actually performed. According to the participants, this should work by using a "finger gun" type gesture where the thumb is first extended and is then tapped against the base of the index finger to confirm the teleport location as seen in \ref{fig:index}. One user also proposed to gesture an "air tap" with the extended index finger. However, he expressed some concern about the accuracy, since moving the finger to confirm could impact the target selection. Twice the second hand was used as a confirmation step but did not influence the targeting system using the pointing hand.

The second biggest group of gestures was named six times. All gestures are using a single, open hand with some kind of confirmation step as shown in \ref{fig:palm2}. Four times closing the hand to a fist was proposed as a confirmation step, with the others quickly tapping the index finger and the thumb together to select the target. Another difference between the systems is also the direction the open hand is pointing towards. Four times a ray would start as the normal vector of the palm of the hand, once out of the middle finger. One other system proposed to have the palm upwards, with an arc used as the targeting visualization. The arc would curve in the direction of the middle finger and could be manipulated by changing the height of the hand. Holding the hand up high makes the arc go further and would therefore allow teleports over a larger distance.

A third group is named five times and is using only bimanual systems that use a targeting system where the selection vector is produced by some kind of "rangefinder", the user is looking through. This could be a triangle formed by touching both index fingers and both thumbs together. This was proposed four times. Another proposed option is a "diamond" form formed by touching all fingers to their equivalent finger of the other hand. This forms a hole that can be used to look through. This was proposed twice. All but one system also include a confirmation step that is performed by closing other fingers to a half fist or pinching the hole together.

Other honorable mentions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wrist mounted laser pointer
    \item Pointing using a thumb
    \item OK-Gesture with using the middle finger to point, confirmed when opening the sign
    \item Throwing a teleport ball to a target
    \item Drawing a circle in the air that will become the new viewport
\end{itemize}

They were all mentioned only once but could also be interesting to investigate.

\section{Discussion}
The results appeared promising for the usability study since most of the intuitively proposed gesture systems by the test subjects are very similar or at least follow the same ideas as the gesture systems found in previous works. There are some notable exceptions however. Only 4 out of 20 gesture systems proposed by the participants did not include an explicit explanation for a confirmation step. This made it apparent that the users would not expect a gesture system based on dwell time like proposed by Sch√§fer et al. \cite{Schafer2021}.
