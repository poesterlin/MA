\section{Introduction}
This project was conducted with the goal of preparing a study environment to compare different gesture based teleportation systems that were found in the literature research phase. The gestures where picked so that they can be compared well and based on user feedback collected in a small gesture elicitation study. The main part of this project is a VR environment, build with Unity and a server connected to the headset for various logging, visualization and debugging tasks.
