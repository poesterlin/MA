The world of virtual reality is getting increasingly diverse. There are all kinds of tools and games build pushing the boundary of what is possible to create. The hardware is also getting more powerful and easier to use. Standalone headsets that do not require a powerful PC linked over a cable are cheaper and sometimes more immersive since the user does not has to keep track of the cable. The next step on the path of simplifying the experience is to make it possible to use VR without controllers. They will still have their place for applications that require very acuate tracking, lots of different types of inputs or where it makes sense to hold something like a gun or paint brush anyway. There are many experiences that do not require this though. This is were hand-tracking will allow the implementation of immersive, natural interfaces. This can allow anybody to just put the headset on and just start interacting with the virtual world without first being told how to grab something or how to activate a button. However, the interactions does have the limitations as stated before but also are challenge to get right. Users are first going to apply the mental model build during decades of experience using their hands in the real world. Differences between the real and the virtual world might therefor make the experience less immersive than if the user would be using a controller were there is no previous knowledge. This raises the question what to do if the virtual world allows the user to do more with their hands than the real world. This projects builds the basis to be able to investigate how locomotion or more specifically teleportation should work using hand-tracking. Teleportation is the most popular form of locomotion in VR. With the help of controllers this usually activated using a joystick or button and even though there are slight differences between each game, you can usually figure out quickly how to do control it. Without controllers there is no established way to control teleportation. The user can also not easily hit all the buttons until some feedback can lead them in the right direction. VR applications based on hand-tracking will therefor still have learning curve for new users. If there is a standard way to use teleportation established it should be based on research though. The prototype implementation build in during this project is therefor build with the requirement to be used in a user study in the future. The results of that study might then help to inform future developers of applications using hand-tracking.


This report is structured in the following way: First a summary of the informal literature review that was conducted before the project explains the current state of the art. Second the performed gesture elicitation study and its results are explained. After this the implemented solution is explained and finally discussed.
