   abstract = {Gesture elicitation studies represent a popular and resourceful method in HCI to inform the design of intuitive gesture commands, reflective of end-users' behavior, for controlling all kinds of interactive devices, applications, and systems. In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users' preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants, 3,625 referents, and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a double hand-gesture interaction (DHGI) method for walk-through in VR environment with an Oculus Rift headset and Leap Motion function. The user can control the avatar (first-person view) to move (walk/run) forward or backward by turning the user's left palm upward or downward, and by turning the avatar to the left or right with the right thumb pointing toward either direction. Compared with the results of the joystick input device and portal method using Oculus Rift Touches, the objective and subjective findings of this study indicate that DHGI is intuitive, easy to learn, easy to use, and causes low fatigue. Moreover, the user feedback shows that DHGI significantly improves immersion and reduces the sense of motion sickness in VR.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has been used as an effective tool for training individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recently there have been an increase in the number of applications developed for this purpose. One of the most important aspects of these applications is locomotion, which is an essential form of human computer interaction. Locomotion in VR has a direct effect on many aspects of user experience such as enjoyment, frustration, tiredness, motion sickness and presence. There have been many locomotion techniques proposed for VR. Most of them were designed and evaluated for neurotypical users. On the other hand, for individuals with ASD there isn't any study to our knowledge that focuses on locomotion techniques and their evaluation. In this study, eight locomotion techniques were implemented in an immersive virtual reality test environment. These eight VR locomotion techniques may be categorized as follows: three commonly used locomotion techniques (redirected walking, walk-in-place and joystick controller), two unexplored locomotion techniques (stepper machine and point \& teleport) and three locomotion techniques that were selected and designed for individuals with ASD based on their common characteristics (flying, flapping and trackball controller). A user study was performed with 12 high functioning individuals with ASD. Results indicated that joystick and point \& teleport techniques provided the most comfortable use for individuals with ASD, followed by walk in place and trackball. On the other hand, flying and hand flapping did not provide comfortable use for individuals with ASD.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) and new devices getting available with relatively lower costs, more and more video games have been developed recently. Most of these games use first person interaction techniques since it is more natural for Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). One of the most widely used interaction technique in VR video games is locomotion that is used to move user's viewpoint in virtual environments. Locomotion is an important component of video games since it can have a strong influence on user experience. In this study, a new locomotion technique we called "Point \& Teleport" is described and compared with two commonly used VR locomotion techniques of walk-in-place and joystick. In this technique, users simply point where they want to be in virtual world and they are teleported to that position. As a major advantage, it is not expected to introduce motion sickness since it does not involve any visible translational motion. In this study, two VR experiments were designed and performed to analyze the Point \& Teleport technique. In the first experiment, Point \& Teleport was compared with walkin-place and joystick locomotion techniques. In the second experiment, a direction component was added to the Point \& Teleport technique so that the users could specify their desired orientation as well. 16 users took part in both experiments. Results indicated that Point \& Teleport is a fun and user friendly locomotion method whereas the additional direction component degraded the user experience.},

ABSTRACT Advances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users' perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users' movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods, diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique's strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.},

abstract = {Figure 1: In our experiment, participants complete block stacking puzzles in virtual reality (left), controlling their avatar's hands either with tracked gloves (middle, left) or with touch controllers (middle, right). The avatar's hands are varied to fit the participant's hands in size or to be 25% larger or smaller (right). ABSTRACT Most commercial virtual reality applications with self avatars provide users with a "one-size fits all" avatar. While the height of this body may be scaled to the user's height, other body proportions, such as limb length and hand size, are rarely customized to fit an individual user. Prior research has shown that mismatches between users' avatars and their actual bodies can affect size perception and feelings of body ownership. In this paper, we consider how concepts related to the virtual hand illusion, user experience, and task efficiency are influenced by variations between the size of a user's actual hand and their avatar's hand. We also consider how using a tracked controller or tracked gestures affect these concepts. We conducted a 2x3 within-subjects study (n=20), with two levels of input modality: using tracked finger motion vs. a hand-held controller (Glove vs. Controller), and three levels of hand scaling (Small, Fit, and Large). Participants completed 2 block-assembly trials for each condition (for a total of 12 trials). Time, mistakes, and a user experience survey were recorded for each trial. Participants experienced stronger feelings of ownership and realism in the Glove condition. Efficiency was higher in the Controller condition and supported by play data of more time spent, blocks grabbed, and blocks dropped in the Glove condition. We did not find enough evidence for a change in agency and the intensity of the virtual hand illusion depending on hand size. Over half of the * participants indicated preferring the Glove condition over the Controller condition, mentioning fun and efficiency as factors in their choices. Preferences on hand scaling were mixed but often attributed to efficiency. Participants liked the appearance of their virtual hand more while using the Fit instead of Large hands. Several interaction effects were observed between input modality and hand scaling, for example, for smaller hands, tracked hands evoked stronger feelings of ownership compared to using a controller. Our results show that the virtual hand illusion is stronger when participants are able to control a hand directly rather than with a hand-held device, and that the virtual reality task must first be considered to determine which modality and hand size are the most applicable.},

abstract = {To localize one's hand, i.e., to find out its position with respect to the body, humans may use proprioceptive information or visual information or both. It is still not known how the CNS combines simultaneous proprioceptive and visual information. In this study, we investigate in what position in a horizontal plane a hand is localized on the basis of simultaneous proprioceptive and visual information and compare this to the positions in which it is localized on the basis of proprioception only and vision only. Seated at a table, subjects matched target positions on the table top with their unseen left hand under the table. The experiment consisted of three series. In each of these series, the target positions were presented in three conditions: by vision only, by proprioception only, or by both vision and proprioception. In one of the three series, the visual information was veridical. In the other two, it was modified by prisms that displaced the visual field to the left and to the right, respectively. The results show that the mean of the positions indicated in the condition with both vision and proprioception generally lies off the straight line through the means of the other two conditions. In most cases the mean lies on the side predicted by a model describing the integration of multisensory information. According to this model, the visual information and the proprioceptive information are weighted with direction-dependent weights, the weights being related to the direction-dependent precision of the information in such a way that the available information is used very efficiently. Because the proposed model also can explain the unexpectedly small sizes of the variable errors in the localization of a seen hand that were reported earlier, there is strong evidence to support this model. The results imply that the CNS has knowledge about the direction-dependent precision of the proprioceptive and visual information.},

Most commercial applications use some form of teleportation or physical walking for moving around in a virtual space. However, teleportation can be disorienting, due to the sudden change in the environment when teleported to another location. Physical walking techniques are more physically demanding, leading to fatigue. Hence, we explore the use of two spatial controllers that accompany commercial headsets to walk by taking a virtual step each time a controller trigger is pulled. The user has the choice of using the orientation of a single-controller, the average of both controllers, or that of the head to determine the direction of walking, and speed can be controlled by changing the angle of the controller to the Frontal plane.},

Between these two extremes there are scenarios when both speed and precision become equally important. In real life, we often seamlessly combine these modes. However, most VR systems support a single travel metaphor, which may only be good for one range of travel, but not others. We present a new VR travel framework which supports three separate multi-touch travel techniques, one for each distance range, but that all use the same device. We use a unifying metaphor of the user's fingers becoming their legs for each of the techniques. We are investigating the usability and user acceptance of the fingers-as-legs metaphor, as well as the efficiency and naturalness of switching between the different travel modes. We conducted an experiment focusing on user performance using the three travel modes, and compared our multi-touch, gesture-based approach with a traditional Gamepad travel interface. The results suggest that participants using a Gamepad interface are more time efficient. However, the quality of completing the tasks with the two input devices was similar, while ForcePad user response was faster for switching between travel modes.},

Overloading the hands with navigation functionality has been considered detrimental to performance given that, in many VR experiences, (i.e., games), controllers are already used for tasks such as shooting or interacting with objects. Existing studies have only evaluated virtual locomotion techniques using a single navigation task.

abstract = {Figure 1: Teleportation discontinuously translates the user's viewpoint over a distance (A ‚Üí B). The absence of optical flow reduces VR sickness, but also limits the users' ability to perform path integration, i.e., estimating the distance traveled, which can lead to spatial disorientation. Dash merges teleportation with regular locomotion by quickly and continuously moving the user to a destination (A ‚Üí C), which generates optical flow that allows for path integration. ABSTRACT Teleportation is a popular locomotion technique that lets users navigate beyond the confines of limited available positional tracking space. Because it discontinuously translates the viewpoint, it is considered a safe locomotion method because it doesn't generate any optical flow, and thus reduces the risk of vection induced VR sickness. Though the lack of optical flow minimizes VR sickness, it also limits path integration, e.g., estimating the total distance traveled, and which can lead to spatial disorientation. This paper evaluates a teleportation technique called Dash that quickly but continuously displaces the user's viewpoint and which retains some optical flow cues. A user study with 16 participants compares Dash to regular teleportation and found that it significantly improves path integration while there was no difference in VR sickness.},

While teleportation produced less cybersickness than steering locomotion on average, a number of participants reported teleportation to be more sickening.

abstract = {The confounding effect of player locomotion on the vestibulo-ocular reflex is one of the principal causes of motion sickness in immersive virtual reality. Continuous motion is particularly problematic for stationary user configurations, and teleportation has become the prevailing approach for providing accessible locomotion. Unfortunately, teleportation can also increase disorientation and reduce a player's sense of presence within a VR environment. This paper presents an alternative locomotion technique designed to preserve accessibility while maintaining feelings of presence. This is a node-based navigation system which allows the player to move between predefined node positions using a rapid, continuous, linear motion. An evaluation was undertaken to compare this locomotion technique with commonly used, teleportation-based and continuous walking approaches. Thirty-six participants took part in a study which examined motion sickness and presence for each technique, while navigating around a virtual house using PlayStation VR. Contrary to intuition, we show that rapid movement speeds reduce players' feelings of motion sickness as compared to continuous movement at normal walking speeds.},

abstract = {The latest technical and interaction advancements within the virtual reality (VR) field have marked a new era, not only for VR, but also for VR locomotion. In this era, well-established, prevalent VR locomotion techniques are mostly used as points of comparison for benchmarking of new VR locomotion designs. At the same time, there is the need for more exploratory, comparative studies of contemporary VR locomotion techniques, so that their distinguished interaction aspects can be documented and guide the design process of new techniques. This article presents a comparative, empirical evaluation study of contemporary and prevalent VR locomotion techniques, examining the user experience (UX) they offer. First, the prevalent VR locomotion techniques are identified based on literature, i.e., walking-in-place, controller/joystick, and teleportation. Twenty-six adults are enrolled in the study and perform a game-like task using the techniques. The study follows a mixed methods approach, utilising the System Usability Scale survey, the Game Experience Questionnaire, and a semistructured interview to assess user experiences. Results indicate that the walking-in-place technique offers the highest immersion but also presents high levels of psychophysical discomfort. Controller/joystick VR locomotion is perceived as easy-to-use due to the users' familiarity with controllers, whereas teleportation is considered to be effective due to its fast navigation, although its visual 'jumps' do break the users' sense of immersion. Based on the interviews, the users focused on the following interaction dimensions to describe their VR locomotion experiences: (i) immersion and flow, (ii) ease-of-use and mastering, (iii) competence and sense of effectiveness, and (iv) psychophysical discomfort. The study implications for VR locomotion are discussed, along with the study limitations and the future direction for research.},

This paper presents a new omni-directional locomotion interface based on step-in-place movement and a smart-turntable system to impart users with the ability to move freely in any direction within VEs without loosing sight of the displayed images despite their projection on a limited large screen that do not provide surrounding or 360 o visual feedback. A sensor-embedded turntable is used as a walking platform, on top of which users will stand at its center to perform walk in place and turn in place movements to steer their navigation through the virtual environment. However, as a large turn action may put the screen outside user's visual field of view, the turntable will cancel user's turnings by a smooth and passive rotation in the opposite direction so as to keep user oriented toward the center of the screen. The novelty of the interface is that a) it uses a smart-turntable as walking platform that compensate users' rotations rather than their displacements b) no cable attachments are made to the user body c) user can make many full body rotations without loosing sight of the environment, virtually providing a surrounding display despite the use of limited size screen.},

Redirected walking and teleportation were subjectively preferred over joystick by the participants. Furthermore, we found a significant effect of an increased motion sickness for joystick-based navigation. Hence, redirected walking as well as teleportation are locomotion techniques with different benefits and drawbacks, and should be preferred.},

However, it is not yet fully understood how the design of more realistic locomotion techniques affects user task performance. We performed an experiment to compare a semi-natural locomotion technique (based on the Virtusphere device) with a traditional, non-natural technique (based on a game controller) and a fully natural technique (real walking). We found that the Virtusphere technique was significantly slower and less accurate than both of the other techniques. Based on this result and others in the literature, we speculate that locomotion techniques with moderate interaction fidelity will often have performance inferior to both high-fidelity techniques and well-designed low-fidelity techniques. We argue that our experimental results are an effect of interaction fidelity, and perform a detailed analysis of the fidelity of the three locomotion techniques to support this argument.},

Most of these games use first person interaction techniques since it is more natural for Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). One of the most widely used interaction technique in VR video games is locomotion that is used to move user's viewpoint in virtual environments. Locomotion is an important component of video games since it can have a strong influence on user experience. In this study, a new locomotion technique we called "Point \& Teleport" is described and compared with two commonly used VR locomotion techniques of walk-in-place and joystick. In this technique, users simply point where they want to be in virtual world and they are teleported to that position. As a major advantage, it is not expected to introduce motion sickness since it does not involve any visible translational motion. In this study, two VR experiments were designed and performed to analyze the Point \& Teleport technique. In the first experiment, Point \& Teleport was compared with walkin-place and joystick locomotion techniques. In the second experiment, a direction component was added to the Point \& Teleport technique so that the users could specify their desired orientation as well. 16 users took part in both experiments. Results indicated that Point \& Teleport is a fun and user friendly locomotion method whereas the additional direction component degraded the user experience.},

Although the latest advancements in VR locomotion have raised the interest of both researchers and users in analyzing and experiencing current VR locomotion techniques, the field of research on VR locomotion, in its new era, is still uncharted. In this work, VR locomotion is explored through a systematic literature review investigating empirical studies of VR locomotion techniques from 2014‚Äì2017. The review analyzes the VR locomotion techniques that have been studied, their interaction-related characteristics and the research topics that were addressed in these studies. Thirty-six articles were identified as relevant to the literature review, and the analysis of the articles resulted in 73 instances of 11 VR locomotion techniques, such as real-walking, walking-in-place, point and teleport, joystick-based locomotion, and more. Results showed that since the VR revival, the focus of VR locomotion research has been on VR technology and various technological aspects, overshadowing the investigation of user experience. From an interaction perspective, the majority of the utilized and studied VR locomotion techniques were found to be based on physical interaction, exploiting physical motion cues for navigation in VR environments. A significant contribution of the literature review lies in the proposed typology for VR locomotion, introducing four distinct VR locomotion types: motion-based, room scale-based, controller-based and teleportation-based locomotion.},

Many of the actions that we take with our hands involve self-contact and occlusion: shaking hands, making a fist, or interlacing our fingers while thinking. This use of of our hands illustrates the importance of tracking hands through self-contact and occlusion for many applications in computer vision and graphics, but existing methods for tracking hands and faces are not designed to treat the extreme amounts of self-contact and self-occlusion exhibited by common hand gestures. By extending recent advances in vision-based tracking and physically based animation, we present the first algorithm capable of tracking high-fidelity hand deformations through highly self-contacting and self-occluding hand gestures, for both single hands and two hands. By constraining a vision-based tracking algorithm with a physically based deformable model, we obtain an algorithm that is robust to the ubiquitous self-interactions and massive self-occlusions exhibited by common hand gestures, allowing us to track two hand interactions and some of the most difficult possible configurations of a human hand.},

Therefore, we firstly propose (1) a large-scale dataset, InterHand2.6M, and (2) a baseline network, InterNet, for 3D interacting hand pose estimation from a single RGB image. The proposed InterHand2.6M consists of 2.6M labeled single and interacting hand frames under various poses from multiple subjects. Our InterNet simultaneously performs 3D single and interacting hand pose estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate big gains in 3D interacting hand pose estimation accuracy when leveraging the interacting hand data in InterHand2.6M. We also report the accuracy of InterNet on InterHand2.6M, which serves as a strong baseline for this new dataset. Finally, we show 3D interacting hand pose estimation results from general images.

abstract = {Figure 1: Features of the Locomotion Vault interactive database and visualization include: filtering by attributes (left image), an animated gallery with individual technique descriptions for over 100 locomotion techniques (middle), and two similarity graphs that are expert-created or calculated from the attributes (right). ABSTRACT Numerous techniques have been proposed for locomotion in virtual reality (VR). Several taxonomies consider a large number of attributes (e.g., hardware, accessibility) to characterize these techniques. However, finding the appropriate locomotion technique (LT) and identifying gaps for future designs in the high-dimensional space of attributes can be quite challenging. To aid analysis and innovation, we devised Locomotion Vault (https://locomotionvault. github.io/), a database and visualization of over 100 LTs from academia and industry. We propose similarity between LTs as a metric to aid navigation and visualization. We show that similarity based on attribute values correlates with expert similarity assessments (a method that does not scale). Our analysis also highlights an inherent trade-off between simulation sickness and accessibility across LTs. As such, Locomotion Vault shows to be a tool that unifies information on LTs and enables their standardization and large-scale comparison to help understand the space of possibilities in VR locomotion.

abstract = {Background Within a virtual environment (VE) the control of locomotion (e.g., self-travel) is critical for creating a realistic and functional experience. Usually the direction of locomotion, while using a head-mounted display (HMD), is determined by the direction the head is pointing and the forward or backward motion is controlled with a hand held controllers. However, hand held devices can be difficult to use while the eyes are covered with a HMD. Free hand gestures, that are tracked with a camera or a hand data glove, have an advantage of eliminating the need to look at the hand controller but the design of hand or finger gestures for this purpose has not been well developed. Methods This study used a depth-sensing camera to track fingertip location (curling and straightening the fingers), which was converted to forward or backward self-travel in the VE. Fingertip position was converted to self-travel velocity using a mapping function with three parameters: a region of zero velocity (dead zone) around the relaxed hand position, a linear relationship of fingertip position to velocity (slope or/J) beginning at the edge of the dead zone, and an exponential relationship rather than a linear one mapping fingertip position to velocity (exponent). Using a HMD, participants moved forward along a virtual road and stopped at a target on the road by controlling self-travel velocity with finger flexion and extension. Each of the 3 mapping function parameters was tested at 3 levels. Outcomes measured included usability ratings, fatigue, nausea, and time to complete the tasks. Results Twenty subjects participated but five did not complete the study due to nausea. The size of the dead zone had little effect on performance or usability. Subjects preferred lower $\beta$ values which were associated with better subjective ratings of control and reduced time to complete the task, especially for large targets. Exponent values of 1.0 or greater were preferred and reduced the time to complete the task, especially for small targets. Conclusions Small finger movements can be used to control velocity of self-travel in VE. The functions used for converting fingertip position to movement velocity influence usability and performance.},

However, long standing issues with unwanted side effects, such as nausea from cybersickness, continue to impact on the general use of devices such as head mounted displays. This in turn has slowed the uptake of more immersive interfaces for computer gaming and indeed more serious applications in training and health. In this paper we report a systematic review in the area of cybersickness with a focus on measuring the diverse symptoms experienced. Indeed the related conditions of simulator sickness and motion sickness have previously been well studied and yet many of the issues are unresolved. Here we report on these issues along with a number of measures, both subjective and objective in nature, using either questionnaires or psychophysiological measures that have been used to study cybersickness. We also report on the factors, individual, device related and task dependent that impact on the condition. We conclude that there remains a need to develop more cost-effective and objective physiological measures of both the impact of cybersickness and a person's susceptibility to the condition.},

Based on this analysis a symptom profile emerged for simulators where Oculomotor symptoms predominated, followed by Nausea and least by Disorientation-like symptoms. Current users of virtual environment (VE) systems have also begun to report varying degrees of what they are calling cybersickness, which initially appeared to be similar to simulator sickness. We have found, after examination of eight experiments using different VE systems, that the profile of cybersickness is sufficiently different from simulator sickness - with Disorientation being the predominant symptom and Oculomotor the least. The total severity of cybersickness was also found to be approximately three times greater than that of simulator sickness. Perhaps these different strains of motion sickness may provide insight into the different causes of the two maladies.},

The primary signs and symptoms of motion sickness are nausea and vomiting. Motion sickness can be provoked by a wide variety of transport environments, including land, sea, air, and space. The recent introduction of new visual technologies may expose more of the population to visually induced motion sickness. This chapter describes the signs and symptoms of motion sickness and different types of provocative stimuli. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù of motion sickness (i.e., the mechanism) is generally accepted to involve sensory conflict, for which the evidence is reviewed. New observations concern the identification of putative ‚Äúsensory conflict‚Äù neurons and the underlying brain mechanisms. But what reason or purpose does motion sickness serve, if any? This is the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of motion sickness, which is analyzed from both evolutionary and nonfunctional maladaptive theoretic perspectives. Individual differences in susceptibility are great in the normal population and predictors are reviewed. Motion sickness susceptibility also varies dramatically between special groups of patients, including those with different types of vestibular disease and in migraineurs. Finally, the efficacy and relative advantages and disadvantages of various behavioral and pharmacologic countermeasures are evaluated.},

Shown here are two proxies, linked to marked spaces (shown in the same color) around two different bookshelves. The user is about to move a book from one space to the other. In addition to direct interactions through them, users can move and arrange proxies, as well as perform operations on them, such as merging and aligning. ABSTRACT A compelling property of virtual reality is that it allows users to interact with objects as they would in the real world. However, such interactions are limited to space within reach. We present Poros, a system that allows users to rearrange space. After marking a portion of space, the distant marked space is mirrored in a nearby proxy. Thereby, users can arrange what is within their reachable space, making it easy to interact with multiple distant spaces as well as nearby objects. Proxies themselves become part of the scene and can be moved, rotated, scaled, or anchored to other objects. Furthermore, they can be used in a set of higher-level interactions such as alignment and action duplication. We show how Poros enables a variety of tasks and applications and also validate its effectiveness through an expert evaluation.},

Because available walking space is limited and teleportation is faster than walking, a risk with using teleportation is that users might end up abandoning walking input and only relying on teleportation, which is considered detrimental to presence. We present redirected teleportation; an improved version of teleportation that uses iterative non-obtrusive reorientation and repositioning using a portal to redirect the user back to the center of the tracking space, where available walking space is larger. A user study compares the effectiveness, accuracy, and usability of redirected teleportation with regular teleportation using a navigation task in three different environments. Results show that redirected teleportation allows for a better utilization of available tracking space than regular teleportation, as it requires significantly fewer teleportations, while users walk more and use a larger portion of the available tracking space.},

A tunnel window, which is created at an arbitrary position in space using a set of hand gesture commands, provides a secondary view whose viewpoint can be controlled independently from that of the primary view. A tunnel window allows various kinds of seamless teleportation operations including teleportation of the user's viewpoint and that of a virtual object from one position to another by simply passing through the window frame. To extend the interaction scheme, a variety of transformation combinations of the relevant coordinate systems, i.e. those of a user, a window frame, and primary and secondary scenes, have been considered.

abstract = {Virtual environments can be infinitely large, but users only have a limited amount of space in the physical world. One way to navigate within large virtual environments is through teleportation. Teleportation requires two steps: targeting a place and sudden shifting. Conventional teleportation uses a controller to point to a target position and a button press or release to immediately teleport the user to the position. Since the teleportation does not require physical movement, the user can explore the entire virtual environment. However, as this is supernatural and can lead to momentary disorientation, it can break the sense of presence, and thus degrade the overall virtual reality experience. To compensate for the downside of this technique, we explore the effects of a jumping gesture as a teleportation trigger. We conducted a study with two factors: 1) triggering method (Jumping and Standing), and 2) targeting method (Head-direction and Controller). We found that the conventional way of using a controller while standing showed better efficiency, the highest usability and lower cybersickness. Nevertheless, Jump-ing+Controller invoked a high sense of engagement and fun, and therefore provides an interesting new technique, especially for VR games.},

In this article, we reflect about this goal of designing gestures that people can easily understand and use and how designers of gestural interaction can capitalize on the experience of 30 years of research on visual languages to achieve it. Concretely, we argue that gestures can be regarded as "visual expressions to convey meaning" and thus are a visual language. Based on what we have learned from visual language research in the past, we then explain why the design of a generic gesture set or language that spans many applications and devices is likely to fail. We also discuss why we recommend using gestural manipulations that enable users to directly manipulate on-screen objects instead of issuing commands with symbolic gestures whose meaning varies among different users, contexts, and cultures.},

However, few works have studied the design space of bimanual hand gestures or attempted to infer gestures that involve devices on both hands. We explore the design space of hand-to-hand gestures, a group of gestures that are performed by touching one hand with the other hand. Hand-to-hand gestures are easy to perform and provide haptic feedback on both hands. Moreover, hand-to-hand gestures generate simultaneous vibration on two hands that can be sensed by dual off-the-shelf wrist-worn devices. In this work, we derive a hand-to-hand gesture vocabulary with subjective ratings from users and select gesture sets for real-life scenarios. We also take advantage of devices on both wrists to demonstrate their gesture-sensing capability. Our results show that the recognition accuracy for fourteen gestures is 94.6% when the user is stationary, and the accuracy for five gestures is 98.4% or 96.3% when the user is walking or running, respectively. This is significantly more accurate than a single device worn on either wrist. Our further evaluation also validates that users can easily remember hand-to-hand gestures and use our technique to invoke commands in real-life contexts.},

The design of hand gestures should be evaluated to determine design features that are the most effective and comfortable for the user. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parameters for the design of 3D hand gestures for object manipulation in virtual reality to optimize productivity and usability. Twenty participants completed object manipulation tasks while wearing an Oculus Rift headset with a mounted Leap Motion depth sensor camera to capture hand gestures. Independent variables were distance from hand to object, hand posture threshold for grab and release, and grab locations on object. The dependent variables were time for task completion and subjective measures of control, fatigue, motion sickness, and preference. The preferred gesture design parameter was related to better control and reduced time to complete the tasks. In conclusion, this study identified important gesture design features that can be optimized to improve usability and throughput for an object manipulation task in Virtual Reality.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a lexicon for 3-D hand gestures for common humancomputer interaction (HCI) tasks by considering usability and effort ratings. Background: Recent technologies create an opportunity for developing a free-form 3-D hand gesture lexicon for HCI. Method: Subjects (N = 30) with prior experience using 2-D gestures on touch screens performed 3-D gestures of their choice for 34 common HCI tasks and rated their gestures on preference, match, ease, and effort. Videos of the 1,300 generated gestures were analyzed for gesture popularity, order, and response times. Gesture hand postures were rated by the authors on biomechanical risk and fatigue. Results: A final task gesture set is proposed based primarily on subjective ratings and hand posture risk. The different dimensions used for evaluating task gestures were not highly correlated and, therefore, measured different properties of the taskgesture match. Application: A method is proposed for generating a user-developed 3-D gesture lexicon for common HCIs that involves subjective ratings and a posture risk rating for minimizing arm and hand fatigue.},

@article{Rempel2014,
abstract = {The design and selection of 3D modeled hand gestures for human-computer interaction should follow principles of natural language combined with the need to optimize gesture contrast and recognition. The selection should also consider the discomfort and fatigue associated with distinct hand postures and motions, especially for common commands. Sign language interpreters have extensive and unique experience forming hand gestures and many suffer from hand pain while gesturing. Professional sign language interpreters (N=24) rated discomfort for hand gestures associated with 47 characters and words and 33 hand postures. Clear associations of discomfort with hand postures were identified. In a nominal logistic regression model, high discomfort was associated with gestures requiring a flexed wrist, discordant adjacent fingers, or extended fingers. These and other findings should be considered in the design of hand gestures to optimize the relationship between human cognitive and physical processes and computer gesture recognition systems for human-computer input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
